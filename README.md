## Project Description

Our project is a digital notebook called KTNBK (short for Kitten Notebook) which provides an easy to use text editor that functions like a notebook. On top of being able to take notes, users will also be able to use several built-in commands in order to make notetaking more efficient. These functions range from a calculator to a built-in Pomodoro technique for effective working. 

KTBNK is targeted towards students, containing unique features to accomodate all of their needs. This program automates common processes students need to perform, makign for a smoother and more intuitive note-taking experience. 

If you don't feel like taking notes, we also included several minigames that you can play to distract yourself from your responsibilities! Please enjoy exploring KTNBK.
